## About The Project 💡  
### "The best way to learn is to suffer through coding assignments!" – Every Professor Ever  

This project was developed for the **Zastosowanie Programowania Obiektowego (ZPO)** course. 🏫 It’s a simple Sudoku app made in **C++ CLI**. Let’s be real: it’s not gonna win any awards, but hey, it works! 🎉  

---

### Features You Didn’t Ask For 🤷‍♂️  
- **3 Amazing Windows** (Yes, THREE!):  
  - 🎮 **Game Panel View**: Where you flex your Sudoku-solving skills.  
  - 🔒 **Login View**: Totally unnecessary, but professors love login screens.  
  - ℹ️ **About View**: Tells you how awesome this app is.  

- **User-Friendly**: By "user-friendly," we mean it won't crash (probably). 💥  
- **C++ CLI**: Because who doesn’t love mixing C++ and .NET? 🧙‍♂️  

> **Why is it so simple?**  
> Because complicated stuff is for people with free time. We had deadlines. 😅

## Why This README? ✍️  
Because life is short, and boring READMEs suck. 🤷‍♂️ Here’s why this one’s cool:  
- **Entertaining**: Admit it, you smiled at least once. 😏  
- **Straight to the Point**: Ain’t nobody got time for fluff.  
- **Memorable**: You’ll remember this README longer than your professor will remember your grade.  

---

## Behind the Code 🧑‍💻  
This app is a testament to:  
- **Teamwork** (aka trying to merge everyone’s spaghetti code).  
- **The Magic of Copy-Paste**: "If Stack Overflow approves, so do we!"  
- **SOLID Principles**: Because "Solidne Oprogramowanie" is a vibe. 💪
